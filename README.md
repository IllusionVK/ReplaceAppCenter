# Replace App Center
#### A place to discuss Alternatives

----------------

In this post Microsoft have said that they are shutting down support for cordova
https://devblogs.microsoft.com/appcenter/announcing-apache-cordova-retirement/

It is expected that this will also kill this that has only relatively recently been working well https://github.com/mapiacompany/capacitor-codepush

One alternative alternative is Ionic's AppFlow, but with a $499/month price tag, it‚Äôs not an option for some developers.

So, we're all developers, right ?  So why don't we all contribute and work towards our own alternative?  Yes this will take some of your time, and time is money, but we either do it, kill the feature in our app, or pay $499/month....  The worst outcome = 500 differnt teams all go and do this on their own...  Better if we can all pool our resources...

I don't have personal experince, but it seems many people (mainly in China) use https://github.com/lisong/code-push-server to allow for pushing updates.  So could a few people help to check this out and see how it goes, and then perhaps a few people could help to adjust it (if needed) to work with

- https://github.com/mapiacompany/capacitor-codepush

Do you have Thoughts/Questions/Comments  ?  Lets discuss in issues ?

UPDATE 1:  A few people have said they will be 'watching' this repo to see what happens....  Which is a bit passive...  Can i ask that anyone who wants a solution actively adds a reply in the issues and tells us how they use it / what they can possibly contribute / at a very very minimum adds words of encouragement/describes how they will buy everyone who works on it a ferrari when they have made their 2nd million dollars? ü§£  Just waiting for someone else to create a solution for you will result in the same problem we have now = no alternative.  We will need to have as many interested people as possible to pull together and work on this so that we have a supported solution for the long term..  So please don't just follow, please engage. üëç
