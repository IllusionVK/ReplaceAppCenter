# Replace App Center
#### A place to discuss Alternatives

----------------

In this post Microsoft have said that they are shutting down support for cordova
https://devblogs.microsoft.com/appcenter/announcing-apache-cordova-retirement/

It is expected that this will also kill this that has only relatively recently been working well https://github.com/mapiacompany/capacitor-codepush

One alternative alternative is Ionic's AppFlow, but with a $499/month price tag, itâ€™s not an option for some developers.

So, we're all developers, right ?  So why don't we all contribute and work towards our own alternative?  Yes this will take some of your time, and time is money, but we either do it, kill the feature in our app, or pay $499/month....  The worst outcome = 500 differnt teams all go and do this on their own...  Better if we can all pool our resources...

I don't have personal experince, but it seems many people (mainly in China) use https://github.com/lisong/code-push-server to allow for pushing updates.  So could a few people help to check this out and see how it goes, and then perhaps a few people could help to adjust it (if needed) to work with
